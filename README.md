## Translation Contribution Guide:

1.	**Review Existing Issues:** Before starting your translation, please review both open and closed issues to avoid duplication of efforts.
2.	**Issue Creation:** Clearly specify the UIFlow version (1.0 or 2.0) and the module you plan to translate, including the target language.

    •   Example: Translate the “Button” module in UIFlow 2.0 under the Hardware category into Japanese.

    •	Title your issue as: “[UIFlow 2.0] [JP] Hardware-Button”.

3.	**Fork the Repository:** Fork this repository to your personal space.
4.	**Begin Translation:** Start translating the content. Please use a similar writing style to the existing translation, keep the text simple, and please keep any references to return values (e.g., return bytes).Once completed, push the changes to your forked repository.
5.	**Pre-Pull Request Check:** Ensure the translated text fits the display constraints. Overly long sentences or words might cause display issues on the webpage.
6.	**Submit a Pull Request (PR):** When ready, submit a PR. Make sure to link the PR to the specific issue you created and ensure it aligns with the module discussed in the issue.
7.	**Review and Merge:** We typically review and merge contributions during the week of a new version release. Please be patient during this process.
8.	**Completion:** Congratulations! Your translation will be included in the next release. Thank you for your contribution!
